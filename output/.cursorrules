# UserBX Project Rules & Context

## Project Overview
- **Framework**: Laravel 10/11 (PHP)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: Blade Templates using Tailwind CSS (via CDN or built).
- **Admin Panel**: Located at `/admin`, uses specific CRUD controllers.

## Key Libraries
- **Spatie Media Library**: Used for handling image uploads.
  - Models typically use `InteractsWithMedia` trait.
  - Images are often accessed via `$model->image->url` (custom attribute logic often present).

## Conventions
- **Routing**: Main frontend routes are in `routes/web.php`. Admin routes are also there, often grouped.
- **Controllers**:
  - Frontend: Often using Closures in `routes/web.php` or `HomeController`.
  - Admin: `App\Http\Controllers\Admin\`.
- **Media**:
  - When seeding, use `preservingOriginal()` if getting images from `public/assets/img`.
  - Run `php artisan storage:link` if images allow broken.

## Workflow for New Sections
1. **Database**: Check/Create Migration & Model.
2. **Admin**: Ensure CRUD at `admin/{resource}` works.
3. **Seeding**: Create a Seeder with dummy data (often using existing `public/assets` images).
4. **Frontend**:
   - Fetch data in Route/Controller.
   - Replace static HTML in `home.blade.php` with dynamic Blade loops.
